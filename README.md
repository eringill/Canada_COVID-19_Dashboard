*Canada_COVID-19_Dashboard*

This is a data science / data visualization project that I am undertaking in my spare time in order to learn bokeh and refine my python skills. This is very much a work in progress. The purpose of the dashboard is for users to be able to explore Canadian COVID-19 data in an interactive manner. 

In order to access the dashboard, click on the button below, then click on the file "main.py.ipynb". Execute all three cells of code, and you'll be able to interact with live data. To hide lines in line graphs, click on the corresponding line in the legend.
